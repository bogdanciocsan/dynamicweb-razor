# dynamicweb-razor

Here I will add some snippets that I use when working with Dynamicweb.

I currently created a radio button loop using standard DW information, that works with the Form for Data Lists, that gives more freedom regarding how the dom elements will be outputted (e.g so you can use the with Bootstrap, or another framework) 

It is located at this following link:
